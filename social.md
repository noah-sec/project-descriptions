<!-- IMPACT -->
<h3><b>Business Impact:</b></h3>

<p>Social engineering is a term that often encapsulates attack vectors using humans to achieve cyber effects. Whereas an insider threat is a willing threat actor or accomplice, social engineering is used to deceive and manipulate people using psychological and social vulnerabilities. Attackers often gain initial access to organizational assets using forms of phishing that steal valid credentials from privileged staff accounts. More advanced offensive cyber operations by security firms, intelligence agencies, military branches, and organized crime groups often use social engineering as part of a multi-faceted strategy to compromise and maintain long-term access to organizational assets. Deceptive social engineering methods also include sock puppets, which are fake online accounts used to gather information or influence individuals.    
<br><br>
This investigation and report involved active intelligence gathering using social engineering techniques to support physical intrusion as part of an overall security assessment. Sock puppet social media accounts for interactive internet activities were designed and utilized. Phishing and whaling techniques were used to compromise the security posture of an executive and a corporate headquarters. A separate but related project involved setting up a phishing campaign for offensive cyber operations, including server infrastructure for intercepting credentials and session tokens.</p><br>

<!-- ARCHITECTURE -->
<h3><b>Technical Architecture:</b></h3>

<p>The investigation was over two full business days of researcher/analyst workload. The report was over 150 pages including screenshots.</p><br>

<!-- IMPLEMENTATION -->
<h3><b>Technical Implementation:</b></h3>

<p>Sock puppets were created using generative AI tools for realistic biographical details and profile pictures. Social engineering methods were used to support physical intrusion, such as event infiltration and staff impersonation. Server infrastructure for operations included Evilginx and GoPhish. Generative AI was tuned to contribute to crafting convincing deceptive email and SMS text messages.
