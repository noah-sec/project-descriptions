<h1 align=center>Automated Implementation of WN10-CC-000007</h1>

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<p align=center><i><b>Windows 10 must cover or disable the built-in or attached camera when not in use.</b></i></p><hr>

<h3><b>Business Impact:</b></h3>

<p>"It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors. Failing to disconnect from collaborative computing devices (i.e., cameras) can result in subsequent compromises of organizational information. Providing easy methods to physically disconnect from such devices after a collaborative computing session helps to ensure that participants actually carry out the disconnect activity without having to go through complex and tedious procedures."

<h3><b>Technical Implementation:</b></h3>

<p>1. Scanned Windows 10 Azure VM with Tenable Nessus using DISA STIG compliance audit policy.<br>
<img width=100% src="https://github.com/noah-sec/project-descriptions/blob/main/assets/stig-scan.png">
2. Exported scan results to an <a href="https://github.com/noah-sec/project-descriptions/blob/main/assets/stig-report.pdf">audit report</a>.<br>

3. Examined the <a href="https://stigaview.com/products/win10/v3r1/WN10-CC-000007/">steps</a> to remediate vulnerability WN10-CC-000007.<br>

4. Developed a <a href="https://github.com/noah-sec/powershell-toolbox/blob/main/WN10-CC-000007.ps1">PowerShell script</a> to automatically implement the STIG fix.<br>
  
```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    This PowerShell script disables webcam access for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps.
    
.DESCRIPTION
    Requires elevated PowerShell session (run as Administrator).

.EXAMPLE
    .\WN10-CC-000007.ps1
#>
#Requires -RunAsAdministrator

# Defines the registry path, value name, and data to deny webcam access for UWP apps.
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CapabilityAccessManager\ConsentStore\webcam"
$valueName = "Value"
$valueData = "Deny" # Enclose "Deny" in quotes as it's a string, not a numerical DWord type

# Checks if the registry path exists and creates it if not.
if (-not (Test-Path $registryPath)) {
    Write-Host "Registry path '$registryPath' not found. Creating it now."
    New-Item -Path $registryPath -Force
} else {
    Write-Host "Registry path '$registryPath' already exists."
}

# Sets the 'Value' registry entry to "Deny", preventing UWP apps from accessing the webcam.
Set-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $valueName -Value $valueData -Type String # Change Type to String

# Confirms that the registry value has been set.
Write-Host "Registry value '$valueName' set to '$valueData' at '$registryPath'."
```
<br>5. Ran the script and tested that the STIG fix was implemented.</p><hr>
