<!-- IMPACT -->
### Business Impact

<p>Cyber influence is the use of cyber tools and techniques to influence the behavior of individuals and groups of individuals, and also to influence the behavior of people to achieve cyber effects. Cyber influence is often informed by cyber psychology, which is the behavior behind how humans interact with cyber systems. Cyber influence is sometimes helpful to the user experience (UX), where product design can influence and improve user interaction through slight modification to cyber psychology. Cyber influence is also used in advertising and commerce, where behavioral techniques are used to nudge consumers toward specific purchase decisions. 
<br><br>
The most potent forms of cyber influence are achieved by international corporations, specialized firms, and nation state actors as they conduct military and intelligence influence operations to shape narratives and sentiment. Information operations and psychological operations are both focused on influence. Cyber information operations weaponize both true (malinformation) and false (disinformation) information through digital networks to reach an unprecedented size of audience. Cyber psychological operations, or interactive internet activities, use bots and sock puppets to support or deny the spread of narratives and sentiment.
<br><br>
This project analyzed over a dozen examples of media artifact, and comprehensively deconstructed potential biases and political objectives. It also involved developing a methodology for systematically checking sources of information for factual basis.

### Technical Architecture

<p>The project was setup to analyze a collection of media artifacts chosen in a controlled setting by a leading international NGO that specializes in counter-disinformation. Industry-standard methodology used by international journalists to counter hostile nation state information operations was practiced and demonstrated on the collection of artifacts.</p><br>
