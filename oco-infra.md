<!-- TITLE -->
<h1 align=center>Offensive Cyber Operations Infrastructure Development</h1>

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<p align=center><i>Developed and deployed a custom command-and-control infrastructure setup. Used a custom redirector and payload server to perform a professional offensive cyber operations case study. Used red team methodology to protect operational security of deployment.</i></p>

<h3><b>Business Impact:</b></h3>

<p>While security assessments like penetration tests can discover vulnerabilities and attack paths, these tests are usually limited in scope and don't accurately simulate the experience of a real-world and sophisticated criminal cyber operation. Red teaming and offensive security operations are meant to provide a more comprehensive and realistic assessment of an organizations defenses using real tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of known adversarial cyber organizations. A red team assessment is usually performed at the height of cybersecurity maturity, with some organizations having internal red teams and some security firms completely specializing in contracted external red teaming.
<br><br>
Command-and-control (C2) is a quintessential concept for leadership in critical sectors like banking and the military, referring to the structure(s) that supports leadership ability to enforce orders sent down the hierarchical chain-of-command. If command-and-control of assets is disrupted, this means that leadership no longer has effective control over these assets. A command-and-control (C2) system in the context of offensive cyber operations is an infrastructure setup that allows the operators to achieve hostile takeover of cyber assets. The operators usually achieve initial access to the systems they want to compromise and then establish a C2 channel, which is a two way communication stream that allows operators to send commands in and receive data out of the compromised systems. C2 infrastructure usually has various ways of hiding this channel such as disguising it with normal organizational traffic. If the communication is traced, the C2 infrastructure usually has a "redirector" that can hide the true IP addresses and physical location of the C2 infrastructure, preventing this infrastructure from being easily blocked by firewalls based on IP address or location.
