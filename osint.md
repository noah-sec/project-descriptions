<!-- IMPACT -->
### Business Impact

<p>Open-source intelligence is similar to private investigation, but uses primarily cyber tools and techniques that are not bound by the same laws and regulations as some methods used by licensed private investigators. Journalists, intelligence operatives, and corporate investigators alike use OSINT tools and techniques to facilitate informed stakeholder decision-making. These methods can track individuals through their digital footprints, assess weaknesses in the digital and physical security posture of organizations, and find specific locations with clues and metadata.<br>
Open-source intelligence researchers and analysts can help organizations understand threats and gather evidence. 
<br><br>
This investigation involved gathering intelligence for a security firm to support offensive operations around a Fortune 100 CEO, a Fortune 10 corporate headquarters, and multiple sensitive public events. The investigation used modern cyber targeting tools to track VIPs across multiple locations, assess weaknesses in security posture for a corporate campus, and obtain actionable intelligence for social engineering operations.</p><br>

<!-- ARCHITECTURE -->
### Technical Architecture

<p>The investigation was over two full business days of researcher/analyst workload. The report was over 150 pages including screenshots.</p><br>

<!-- IMPLEMENTATION -->
### Technical Implementation

<p>Numerous tools in browser and CLI were used to parse website subdirectories, DNS records, email addresses and usernames for data breaches, phone number information, file metadata, and geolocation. Gathered public information using advanced Google dorking and search queries, including for social media websites like X and Instagram. Used reverse image search and image metadata information gathering techniques, including geolocation of both urban and wilderness locations from image artifacts.
