<!-- TITLE -->
<h1 align=center>Real-Time Threat Intelligence with Deceptive Assets, Services, & Users</h1>

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<p align=center><i>Researched documentation and deployed various types of honeypot and deception tools into an existing IT infrastructure, <br>including honeypot services/ports, users, devices, and files.</i></p>

<!-- IMPACT -->
<h3><b>Business Impact:</b></h3>

<p>Cyber deception has four unique security impacts to an organization compared to other categories of security tools. Firstly, cyber deception tools and techniques can detect events earlier in a security incident than other types of technical control, reducing the time it takes to detect and respond to such incidents. Secondly, these tools and techniques can detect threats that usually get lost in heaps of logs and metrics, and they have very few false positives or misfires when properly deployed. Thirdly, these tools allow the organization to build real-time threat intelligence that is contextual to its own specific environment. Finally, cyber deception can dramatically shift the cyber psychology of threat actors who seek to compromise assets. Cyber psychology is how humans behave while interacting with cyber systems.
<br><br>
With this cyber deception deployment of honeypots and decoys, stakeholders can be alerted to specific high-threat events such as someone attempting to gain access to a privileged account, a sensitive file, or a decoy device. Canaries are tailored to the specific IT infrastructure - with deceptive services, users, devices, and files that match the existing production evironment. This allows these deceptive canaries to blend in and be more likely to trigger alerts. When properly configured, these canaries should have few to zero false positives. This allows for less busywork and micromanagement of the security solution.</p><br>
