<!-- IMPACT -->
### Business Impact

<p>Cyber deception has three unique security impacts to an organization compared to other categories of security tools. Firstly, cyber deception tools and techniques can reduce the time it takes to detect and respond to an incident. Secondly, these tools and techniques can detect threats that usually get lost in heaps of logs and metrics. Thirdly, these tools allow the organization to build real-time threat intelligence that is specific to it's own context.
<br><br>
With this cyber deception deployment of honeypots and decoys, stakeholders can be alerted to specific high-threat events such as someone attempting to gain access to a privileged account, a sensitive file, or a decoy device. Canaries are tailored to the specific IT infrastructure - with deceptive services, users, devices, and files that match the existing production evironment. This allows these deceptive canaries to blend in and be more likely to trigger alerts. When properly configured, these canaries should have few to zero false positives. This allows for less busywork micro-managing of the security solution.</p><br>
